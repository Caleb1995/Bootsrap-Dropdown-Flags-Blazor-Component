# Bootsrap-Dropdown-Flags-Blazor-Component
A flag dropdown select component

This is a dropdown of countries with their flags
Pass a list of key value pairs to the component and an optional value if you are doing an edit.
Pass an EventCallback method to the component to specify what you want to do with your selection.
I've added a sample sql server table for countries to the repo.

Enjoy!!!
